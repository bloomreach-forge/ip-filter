# Hippo IP Filter Plugin

Control access to CMS and site based on the IP-address of incoming requests.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/ip-filter](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/ip-filter)

The documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn clean site:site -Pgithub.pages 
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target``` 
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
