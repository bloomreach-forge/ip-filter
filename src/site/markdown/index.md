## Introduction 

The BloomReach IP Filter plugin provides request filters to be installed in your site and/or CMS application. 
With these filters, you can control access to site and CMS based on the IP address of incoming requests, using 
IP whitelisting. 

The configuration for the filters resides in the repository and is therefore manageable by administrators through the 
Hippo console webapplication. The big benefit is that your infra team no longer has to be involved for IP filtering 
on webserver (Apache, nginx) level.

## Code on GitHub

The open source code is on GitHub at [github.com/bloomreach-forge/ip-filter](https://github.com/bloomreach-forge/ip-filter)
